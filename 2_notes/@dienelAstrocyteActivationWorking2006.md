### Abstract:
Glucose delivered to brain by the cerebral circulation is the major and obligatory fuel for all brain cells, and assays of functional activity in working brain routinely focus on glucose utilization. However, these assays do not take into account the contributions of minor substrates or endogenous fuel consumed by astrocytes during brain activation, and emerging evidence suggests that glycogen, acetate, and, perhaps, glutamate, are metabolized by working astrocytes in vivo to provide physiologically significant amounts of energy in addition to that derived from glucose. Rates of glycogenolysis during sensory stimulation of normal, conscious rats are high enough to support the notion that glycogen can contribute substantially to astrocytic glucose utilization during activation. Oxidative metabolism of glucose provides most of the ATP for cultured astrocytes, and a substantial contribution of respiration to astrocyte energetics is supported by recent in vivo studies. Astrocytes preferentially oxidize acetate taken up into brain from blood, and calculated local rates of acetate utilization in vivo are within the range of calculated rates of glucose oxidation in astrocytes. Glutamate may also serve as an energy source for activated astrocytes in vivo because astrocytes in tissue culture and in adult brain tissue readily oxidize glutamate. Taken together, contributions of minor metabolites derived from endogenous and exogenous sources add substantially to the energy obtained by astrocytes from blood-borne glucose. Because energy-generating reactions from minor substrates are not taken into account by routine assays of functional metabolism, they reflect a "hidden cost" of astrocyte work in vivo.
